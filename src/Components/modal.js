                            Creating a website, and by extension a blog, can be an intimidating endeavor. It requires consistent maintenance and updates, as well as the dedication to share new content regularly. But it is for this reason that I believe that building a website is a rewarding experience. In this blog post, I will delve into my recent journey of creating a website using React, reflecting on past projects, and exploring the exciting possibilities that lie ahead.

                            After completing my second year of university, I found myself with a renewed mindset and a desire to revisit my old projects. However, I realized that my familiarity with React had faded over time. To reacquaint myself with the framework and breathe new life into my projects, I decided to build a website using React.
                            <br></br><br></br>
                            As someone who has worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I firmly believe that React is the ideal choice for this website. Its component-based nature and my prior experience with the language make updating the website with new projects a breeze, without diving too deep into html tags and other code.

                            To facilitate easy updates, I employed two essential components: the Project and Post components, found in the project_template.js and post_template.js files, respectively. By passing parameters through these components, I can effortlessly add new projects and blog posts, maintaining a dynamic and engaging website.

                            Overall, the website creation process itself is a delightful and creative journey. I embrace my artistic side and pay attention to intricate details, such as choosing the perfect color palette. Moreover, this experience serves as a valuable learning opportunity, as I improve the scalability of my websiteâ€”a knowledge I intend to apply to my previous projects.

                            Creating a website using React has been an enriching experience. It has allowed me to reconnect with my past projects, unlock my creativity, and embrace the power of React's component-based architecture. I look forward to the exciting road ahead as I continue to evolve my website and share my knowledge and insights in future blog posts.
