    "Creating a website and a blog can be an intimidating endeavour. It requires consistent updates alongside the dedication to share new content regularly. But it is for this reason that I believe that building a website is a rewarding experience. In this blog post, I will delve into my recent journey of creating a website using React, reflecting on past projects, and exploring exciting possibilities in the future."

    "As my first machine learning project, I wanted to approach the material in a way that would ignite and sustain my interest in the subject for the duration of the project. Inspired by Youtube videos of machine learning models learning and eventually beating retro video games, I knew I had found the perfect project. In this blog post, I will discuss my inspirations for this project, learning machine learning, and the difficulties in training the model."

    "In my recent project, I worked with machine learning for the first time. In particular, I used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train a model to play Street Fighter 2. In the process, I learned about and tested various machine learning algorithms, like the Neurological Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT). Although PPO and NEAT serve the same purpose, they differ significantly. In this blog post, I will discuss machine learning and explore the differences between PPO and NEAT."
